What should be happening here is the FiniteStateMachine.txt is the save of a premade FSM via textSave. it is then loaded back into the doccument and re saved as FiniteStateMachine_copy.txt . A similar thing is occuring with FSMSave exept the files end in .fsm instead of .txt . 
Please note to open the FiniteStateMachine.fsm files you must select a text editior.

As one can observe both the originals and the copies contain the same data. And thus saving and loading both work. Please do not be confused by both formats not containing all of the information. TextSave saves all of the information necesary to reamake the FSM in the Gui, but FSMSave is designed to only save the information neccesary to the doccument, and thus cannot be re loaded into the gui, instead it must be loaded by the console or hard coded into a a method. The FSMSave works this way because it seemed useful to be able to load FSM's irregardless of weather or not one is using a the gui as well. This type of saving is done to allow our project as a whole to be more flexible in its uses.

The two Files that start with otherName are to show that the saving does not rely on the names of files to help determine content. They as well should be identical to the other two files of the same save type, should there have been an error in the load section of this test it is important to note that they are copies of the first set of FSM's not the copys so if loading was an error, it would only be the copies that were different.
