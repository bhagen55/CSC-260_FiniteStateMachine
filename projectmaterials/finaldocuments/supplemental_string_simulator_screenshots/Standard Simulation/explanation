This supplemental test case represents a standard simulation.

CLICK 0: This is a premade FSM with a single path. Transitions go from a to b to c to d. Notice the string simulator input sequence in the bottom right indicating simulation in this order.

CLICK 1: The simulation begins at the start state (state a). The transition with weight 'a' leads to state b, which is now highlighted in blue.

CLICK 2: b leads to c.

CLICK 3: c leads to d.

CLICK 4: d leads to e.

CLICK 5: Hitting the string simulator button again does nothing, and the last reached state is still highlighted, indicating the last input of the simulation.
