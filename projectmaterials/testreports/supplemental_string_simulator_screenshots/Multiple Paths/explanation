This supplemental test case represents a simulation in which there are multiple paths to go down but only one correct path.

CLICK 0: This is a premade FSM with a multiple paths. The input string references an existing path from transitions a to b to c to d, however there are multiple transitions leading to separate states. Notice the string simulator input sequence in the bottom right indicating simulation in this order.

CLICK 1: The simulation begins at the start state (state a). The transition with weight 'a' leads to state b, which is now highlighted in blue.

CLICK 2: b leads to c, not f.

CLICK 3: c leads to d, not g.

CLICK 4: d leads to e, not h.

CLICK 5: Hitting the string simulator button again does not lead to another state (namely i), and unhighlights the last state to indicate the simulation is over.
